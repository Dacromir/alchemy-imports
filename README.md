# Alchemy Imports
I'm looking for a better/cleaner way to do this. I have two modules (`users.py` and `buildings.py`) that share a `declarative_base`. That base is contained in `base.py`. I'm trying to find a way to import that file that works both when I run the modules directly as scripts and when I import them in main. I've got a solution in lines 3-6 of each file ([user](https://github.com/Dacromir/alchemy-imports/blob/master/models/user.py#L3-L6) and [building](https://github.com/Dacromir/alchemy-imports/blob/master/models/building.py#L3-L6)), but if feels hacky/clunky and I'm convinced there has to be a better way to do it.
